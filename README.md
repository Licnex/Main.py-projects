Just my first try at project euler problems, Trying to make every problem's solution a function with a wider range of possibilities & uses.
# Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to my Project Euler solutions repository! This is my first attempt at solving Project Euler problems. My goal is to create solutions that are not only correct but also versatile and reusable.

## About Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. A good solution usually requires a combination of mathematics and computer science.

## Objectives

- Solve each problem with a function that can handle a wider range of inputs.
- Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
- Learn and apply new algorithms and data structures.

## Problems Solved

- Problem 1-17

## Contributing

This is just a personal record, not really a real project just yet so no need to contribute, although reporting some bugs in the issues sections would be greatly appritiated.
